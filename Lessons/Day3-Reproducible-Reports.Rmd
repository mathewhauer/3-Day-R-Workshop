# Why Reproducibility?


- Evidence your results are correct.
- Allow others to use our methods and results.

>"An article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result."

# Types of Reproducibility

- **Computational reproducibility:** detailed information is provided about
  + *code, software, hardware and implementation details*.

- **Empirical reproducibility:** detailed information is provided about 
  + non-computational empirical *scientific experiments and observations [data]*. 

- **Statistical reproducibility:** detailed information is provided about 
  + the choice of *statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc*.

# Software tool for reproducibility: *Literate Programming*

>"These tools enable writing and publishing **self-contained documents that include narrative and code used to generate both text and graphical results**.

>In the R ecosystem, knitr [R markdown] and its ancestor Sweave used with RStudio are the main tools for literate computing. Markdown or LaTeX are used for writing the narrative, with chunks of R code sprinkled throughout the narrative. IPython is a popular related system for the Python language, providing an interactive notebook for browser-based literate computing."

# R Markdown = `.Rmd` file = Code + text

`knitr` is a package that converts `.Rmd` files containing code + markdown syntax to a plain text `.md` markdown file, and then to other formats (html, pdf, Word, etc)

# Good practices in RStudio

__Use projects__ ([read this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project
- A project is associated with a directory folder
    + Sets *working directory*
    + Keep data files there
    + Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole
    + Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there
- Only use relative paths, never absolute paths
    + relative (good): `read_csv("data/mydata.csv")`
    + absolute (bad): `read_csv("/home/yourname/Documents/stuff/mydata.csv")`
    
__Advantages of using projects__
- standardize file paths
- keep everything together
- a whole folder can be shared and run on another computer

#  Create an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) 

Two options:
1. click on File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ R Markdown... , or
1. in upper left corner of RStudio click on <img src="images/green_plus_create_file.png">  $\rightarrow$ <img src="images/select_RMarkdown_option.png">

You should see the following text in your editor window:

<center><img src="images/default_rmd_html_wide.png" width="62%" height="10%"></center>


---

# Knit the .Rmd file 

*Before knitting the .Rmd file, you must first **save it**. *

To **knit** the .Rmd file, either
1. click on the knit icon <img src="images/knit_icon.png"> at the top of the editor window 
1. or use keyboard shortcuts
    * Mac: *Command+Shift+K* 
    * PC:  *Ctrl+Shift+K*
1. or use the `render()` command in Console - *See Extensions section for details*

A new window will open with the html output.

Remark:
* The template .Rmd file that RStudio creates will knit to an html file by default
* Later we will go over knitting to other file types

# Spell check

~~Alas, there are no autmatik sepll chekc to katch you're tipos and grammR.~~

* You can manually do a spell check by clicking on the <img src="images/icon_spellcheck.png"> icon above the editor window. 
* There is no built-in grammar check in RStudio.
  + The [`gramr` package](https://github.com/jasdumas/gramr) is an available RStudio Addin.

# Data description: Fisher's (or Anderson's) Iris data set

* n = 150 
* 3 species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolour)
  + 50 measurements of each type of Iris
* variables:
  + sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species

_Can the flower species be determined by these variables?_

# Code chunks

Chunks of R code start with ` ```{r} ` and end with ` ``` `.  
For example, the chunk <img src="images/screenshot_summary_iris.png" width="15%" height="50%"> produces the output

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

---

# Create a code chunk

Code chunks can be created by either

1. Clicking on ![](images/icon_insert.png) $\rightarrow$ ![](images/icon_insert_Rchunk.png) at top right of editor window, or

1. __Keyboard shortcut__
  * Mac:   _Command + Option + I_
  * PC:   _Ctrl + Alt + I_

# Chunk options- most common

.pull-left[
Text in editor:

<img src="images/screenshot_chunks_common.png" width="100%" height="100%">
]

.pull-right[

No options specified: see both code and output
```{r}
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

__`echo`__ determines whether the R code is __displayed__ or not. The default is `TRUE`. When set to `FALSE`, the code is not displayed in the output:
```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

__`eval`__ determines whether the R code is __run__ or not. The default is `TRUE`. When set to `FALSE`, the code is not run but is displayed in the output:
```{r eval=FALSE}
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

]

---

# More chunk options

.pull-left[
Text in editor:

<img src="images/screenshot_chunks_include.png" width="100%" height="100%">
]

.pull-right[
Output: 

__`include`__ determines whether to include the R chunk in the output or not. The default is `TRUE`. When set to `FALSE`, the chunk is run but we do not see the code or its output (note that nothing is displayed below):
```{r include=FALSE}
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

]

* Setting `include=FALSE` is useful when you have R code that you want to run, but do not want to display either the code or its output.

* See the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for more chunk options.


---

# Inline code

* You can also report R code output inline with the text
  * _R code is not shown in this case_ 

.pull-left[
Text in editor:

<img src="images/screenshot_code_inline.png" width="100%" height="100%">
]

.pull-right[

Output: 

```{r include=FALSE}
mean_SepalLength <- mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

The mean sepal length for all 3 species combined is `r round(mean_SepalLength,1)` 
(SD = `r round(sd(iris$Sepal.Length),1)`) cm.

]

* The code above is an example of where `include=FALSE` is used a chunk option to evaluate the code but not show the code or its output. 
  + It saves the mean as `mean_SepalLength`, which can then be used later on.
* For the standard deviation, the inline code did the calculation. 
* Thus it was not necessary to first save the mean as a variable.

---

# Figures


.pull-left[
Text in editor:

<img src="images/screenshot_ggplot.png" width="100%" height="100%">

* Figure dimensions specified with `fig.width` and `fig.height`
* Figure name specified by the chunk label
  * The figure created by the chunk above is called `Sepal_WidthVsHeight-1.png`
  * _Chunk names must be unique!_
* `echo=FALSE` was used to hide the code and only display the figure

]

.pull-right[
Output: 

```{r Sepal_WidthVsHeight, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
library(ggplot2) # loads ggplot2 package
# Don't need to load ggplot2 if already loaded tidyverse package
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, 
                 color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```

]



---

# Tables - with no formatting

* Below we create a summary table with the mean and SD of sepal lengths
* The table is displayed with no special formatting

```{r}
table_sepal_length <- iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(Sepal.Length),
            SD = sd(Sepal.Length))

table_sepal_length
```


---

# Tables - with `kable`

* The `kable` command from the `knitr` package has some basic formatting options
  + __html__ tables: harder to read due to squished spacing; can include caption
  + __markdown__ tables: nicer formatting; width = page width

.pull-left[

# Recommend doing this in 1st chunk of the .Rmd

# Global chunk options

* You can set __global chunk options__ that are __applied to all chunks__ in the .Rmd file
  * Set global options in a chunk at the beginning of the .Rmd file
  * The template .Rmd file already includes a chunk labeled `setup`
  * Add more options as desired to this chunk
* Options are added within the `knitr::opts_chunk$set(...)` command
* Any of the many chunk options can be set in the `setup` chunk

<center><img src="images/screenshot_global_options.png" width="80%" height="90%"></center>

* `fig.path` sets the folder name where figures generated by the .Rmd file will be saved
* See the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for more chunk options.

# One last note... citations

Rmarkdown uses `bibtex` for citation management.

In text citations use a 'citation-key' in the bibtex entry.

These are easily cited as `[@Citationkey]` within the text.

# Reproducible Workflow

# Be Organized

Your files must make sense to yourself 6 months from now, and/or other collaborators.

# No! Absolute! File! Paths! (don't `setwd()`)

Absolute paths $\neq$ reproducible

Relative paths $=$ reproducible (if done correctly)

[Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/about/)'s oft quoted opinion; see post on [Project-oriented
workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

# Project directory structure

- The .Rproj file sets your working/home directory (**USE [PROJECTS](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)**)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Use a relative path, "relative to" the project folder
read_csv("mydata.csv") # looks in .Rproj folder
```


- When .Rmd files knit, they look for sourced files *in the folder they live in*

````
```{r data, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
read_csv("mydata.csv") # looks in .Rmd's folder
```
````

- It's good practice to organize all your code/data/output into separate folders

These three facts together can cause a headache.  
* Enter `here::here()`!

# Dot dot: A tip about "moving up" a directory/folder

- In unix, to point to the folder one level up (it contains the folder you're in), use `..` or `../`
  - As in `cd ..` moves up one directory, 
  - or `cp ../myfile.txt newfile.txt` copies a file one level up into the current folder (working directory)
- In `.Rmd` when you want to source the data in the `data/` folder, you could use `..` to move up a folder into the main directory, and then back down into the `data/` folder:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# From the .Rmd folder, move up one folder then down to the data folder
mydata <- read_csv("../data/report3_nhanes_data.csv")
```
